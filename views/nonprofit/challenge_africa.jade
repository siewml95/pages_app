                |Challenge Africa is a small organisation working alongside local people to improve their lives. We are called Challenge Africa, because our projects challenge small communities to work together to find sustainable ways to address huge issues like HIV infection rates and the educational attainment of girls. 
                |Our projects target orphans and vulnerable children, HIV positive individuals and families, vulnerable girls and women but we try to involve the whole community, improving life for all. We believe in a hand up, not a hand out, so we ensure that every donation dollar goes directly towards projects that make a difference.

                |Challenge Africa’s projects are diverse ranging from egg farms for feeding orphans, to memory book counseling enabling children to have a lasting record of their lost parent. We try to involve the whole community; encouraging young men to join our football teams and access vital health messages which will protect them and their future partners. 
                |Our farm offers agricultural lessons to help improve farming output and we help families grow their own vegetables and trees, securing livelihoods and building a greater understanding of how best to manage natural resources in order to protect and improve the environment.
