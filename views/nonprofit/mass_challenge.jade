                |We run an annual global startup accelerator programme and competition, which
                |involves documenting key resources and organising training and networking events. We 
                |envisage a creative and inspired society in which everyone recognises that they can define
                |their future, and is empowered to maximise their impact. After 5 years of success in
                |Boston, MassChallenge is expanding worldwide and the UK is a significant step in that 
                |expansion. In year 1 we have so far taken on 90 start ups and helped them with mentoring,
                |funding, and several very successful networking events within the business ecosystem.
